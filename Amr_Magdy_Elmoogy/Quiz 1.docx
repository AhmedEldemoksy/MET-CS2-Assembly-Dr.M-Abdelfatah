Quiz 1                                                                  20/2/2020
In the Hypothetical Machine the contents of memory was as shown. And PC contents is 300. Show the contents of memory and PC , AC , IR after execute three instructions (three fetch cycle and there execute cycle)

 
First fetch cycle and execute :
Memory         CPU Register           
200 -> 1940     PC -> 200           
201 -> 5941     AC -> 0003
202 -> 2941     IR -> 1940 
940 -> 0003 
941 -> 0002

Second fetch cycle and execute :
Memory         CPU Register           
200 -> 1940     PC -> 201         
201 -> 5941   AC -> 0005
202 -> 2941     IR -> 5941
940 -> 0003 
941 -> 0002

Third fetch cycle and execute : 
Memory         CPU Register           
200 -> 1940     PC -> 202         
201 -> 5941     AC -> 0005
202 -> 2941   IR -> 2941
940 -> 0003 
941 -> 0005










Show the contents of PC , AC and IR and memory after the execution of each instruction of the following program on the Hypothetical Machine:
300 LOAD 550
301 ADD 551
302 STORE 600
Solution : 
 
Memory            CPU Register

300 -> 1550      PC -> 300 
301 -> 5551      AC -> 0003
302 -> 2600      IR -> 1550

550 -> 0003 
551 -> 0004 

Memory            CPU Register

300 -> 1550      PC -> 301
301 -> 5551      AC -> 0007
302 -> 2600      IR -> 5550

550 -> 0003 
551 -> 0004 

Memory            CPU Register

300 -> 1550      PC -> 302
301 -> 5551      AC -> 0007
302 -> 2600      IR -> 2600

550 -> 0003 
551 -> 0007 


Where the contents of memory at 550 is 3 and at 551 is 4.
The following figure provide the main characteristics of Hypothetical Machine.
 




The hypothetical machine also has two I/O instructions:
0011 = load AC from I/O
0111 =store AC to I/O
In these case, the 12-bi address identifies a particular I/O device. Show the program execution for the following program: 
1.  Load AC from device 5.
2. Add contents of memory location 940.
3. Store AC to device 6.
Assume that the next value retrieved from device 5 is 3 and that location 940 contains a value of 2.
Solution : 
IR -> 3005       AC -> 0003
IR -> 5940       AC -> 0005
IR -> 7006       
Device 6 -> AC
