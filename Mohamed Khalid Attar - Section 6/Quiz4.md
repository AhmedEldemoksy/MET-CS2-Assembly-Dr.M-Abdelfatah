# Q1: Write notes about the types of ROM? 

- Mask Programmed ROM.
> A type of ROM programmed during Manufacturing.
- Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM).
> Blows out fuses to produce '0'.
- Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM).
> Erases all data by Ultra Violet exposure.
- Electrically Erasable PROM (EEPROM).
> Erases the required data using an electrical signal.


# Q2: The main difference between RAM and ROM is

> Answer: The main difference is RAM is able to Read and Write data, While ROM can only read data.

###    a) Read / Write 
###    b) Read Only 
###    c) No Read / Write 
###    d) None of the above. 
    
# Q3: The size of Memory is depending on 

###    **->a) Address lines**
###    b) Data lines 
###    c) OR gates 
###    d) Address lines and Data lines


# Q4: True or False

###    1. 1 bit = 8 bytes [ **F** ]
###    2. 16-Byte word = 4 bytes [ **F** ]
###    3. 32-bit word = 4 bytes [ **T** ]
###    4. RAM is able to provide READ / WRITE [ **T** ]
###    5. ROM is programmed and the data is stored based on Hexadecimal system [ **F** ]
###    6. G(giga)=2^20, it means the number of address lines is 20 [ **F** ]
###    7. 64K = 2^16, the address lines is 64. [ **T** ]
