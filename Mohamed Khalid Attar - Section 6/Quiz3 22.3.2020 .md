# 1. List the access method on Memory? 
### A:
    • Sequential Access
    • Direct Access
    • Random Access
    • Associative Access
# 2. Write notes about “Word” on Memory?
### A:
It is the natural unit of organization of memory. The size of a word is typically equal to the number of bits used to represent an integer and to the instruction Length. But, there are many exceptions as the CRAY C90 for instance, which is an older supercomputer model of CRAY, has a 64-Bit word length but a 46-Bit integer representation. The Intel x86 architecture has a wide variety of instruction lengths expressed as multiples of bytes and a word size of 32 bits.
# 3. Write notes about Memory hierarchy?
### A:
The memory hierarchy is a concept used to discuss performance issues in computer architectural design and it can be summed up by three questions;
    1. How much?
    2. How fast?
    3. How expensive? 
The solution to this issue is to rely on a memory hierarchy which can be summed up in Decreasing the cost per bit, Increasing Capacity, Increasing access time, Decreasing frequency of memory access by the processor.
