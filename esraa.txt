    1. List the access method on Memory? 
    Each memory type, is a collection of numerous memory locations. To access data from any memory, first it must be located and then the data is read from the memory location. Following are the methods to access information from memory locations:

1.Random Access: Main memories are random access memories, in which each memory location has a unique address. Using this unique address any memory location can be reached in the same amount of time in any order.


2.Sequential Access: This methods allows memory access in a sequence or in order.


3.Direct Access: In this mode, information is stored in tracks, with each track having a separate read/write head.


  2.Write notes about “Word” on Memory?
 
In computer architecture, a word is an ordered set of bytes or bits that is the normal unit in which information may be stored, transmitted, or operated on within a given computer. If a computer's memory is word-addressable then each word in memory is assigned its own memory address.
  
  3. Write notes about Memory hierarchy?
  
   
The processor can move from one level to another based on its requirements. The five hierarchies in the memory are registers, cache, main memory, magnetic discs, and magnetic tapes. The first three hierarchies are volatile memories which mean when there is no power, and then automatically they lose their stored data.
