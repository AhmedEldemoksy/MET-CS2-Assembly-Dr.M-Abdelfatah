  MAR ,which is found inside the cpu, It is a temporary storage component in the cpu(central processing unit)
 which temporarily stores the address(location) of the data sent by the memory  until the instruction for 
the particular data is executed.


But if you give it a wrong address,it will reah to wrong data and make a wrong instruction so make sure 
that you entered a right data.
